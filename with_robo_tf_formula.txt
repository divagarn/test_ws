Formula to Calculate x-coordinate of Top-Left Corner of Rotated Rectangle
Description:
The formula x0 = x + w/2 * cos(θ) - h/2 * sin(θ) is used to calculate the x-coordinate (x0) of the top-left corner of a rotated rectangle. This calculation is essential when drawing a rotated rectangle on an image, map, or visualization, where the center of the rectangle (x, y), its size (w, h), and its orientation (θ, also known as yaw) are known.

Variables:

x0: x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the rotated rectangle.
x: x-coordinate of the center of the rectangle.
w: Width of the rectangle.
h: Height of the rectangle.
θ (yaw): Angle of orientation of the rectangle, measured in radians. It determines how much the rectangle is rotated counterclockwise from its original orientation.
Step-by-Step Calculation:

w/2 * cos(θ): This term represents the x-offset of the top-left corner from the center of the rectangle. It's half of the rectangle's width (w/2) multiplied by the cosine of the rotation angle (cos(θ)). The cosine function gives us the horizontal displacement caused by the rotation.

h/2 * sin(θ): This term represents the y-offset of the top-left corner from the center of the rectangle. It's half of the rectangle's height (h/2) multiplied by the sine of the rotation angle (sin(θ)). The sine function gives us the vertical displacement caused by the rotation.

x + w/2 * cos(θ) - h/2 * sin(θ): Combining the two offsets, this expression calculates the final x-coordinate (x0) of the top-left corner of the rotated rectangle. It adds the x-coordinate of the center of the rectangle (x) to the x-offset (w/2 * cos(θ)) and subtracts the y-offset (h/2 * sin(θ)) from it.

Application:
The formula is used in various computer vision, image processing, and robotics applications. It allows accurate positioning of the top-left corner of a rotated rectangle, which is crucial for drawing and visualizing the orientation of objects (e.g., robots) on images or occupancy grid maps.

Note:
Make sure to provide the angle θ in radians, as the trigonometric functions (cos and sin) expect angles in radians, not degrees. If θ is in degrees, it should be converted to radians before using this formula.
